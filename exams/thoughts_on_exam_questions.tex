The exam will be designed to test your understanding of a set of key concepts
covered. To test understanding rather than recall I will include questions whose
answers have not been directly covered in the course, but which can be derived.
For these points will be rewarded both for correct answers and
for an ability to make inference and the ability to argue the point.

I hope that at the end of the course, you will have not only gained an understanding
of key concepts but that you will also start to hold opinions on obscure
things like counting from 0 or 1 (OK, so maybe that's not particularly obscure, but...). 

Minimal requirements for the course:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Central Dogma. You must understand how amino acid sequences are encoded
  into DNA sequences and the relationship between transcribed regions, exons,
  introns, coding regions (ORFs) and how these differ between eukaryotes and
  prokaryotes.
