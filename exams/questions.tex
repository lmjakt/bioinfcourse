\section{Bioinformatics in General}
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is bioinformatics and why is it becoming an essential topic for
  biologists?\\
  Note that the there is no single correct answer to this question, and that
  you will not be judged on what you argue, but on how reasonable and informed
  your argument is.
  
  In your answer you may wish to consider the following:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item your opinion of what bioinformatics is
  \item the technologies or skills that are used within the field
  \item the impact of technological process on biological experiments
  \end{itemize}
  \item Describe some examples of problems and fields addressed by
    Bioinformatics. Full marks require at least three examples; points
    will be given both for depth of explanation and for numbers of points.
  \item Why is there such an emphasis of the analysis of sequences within
    bioinformatics? (Any reasonable answer will be accepted).
  \item Describe and contrast how genes were identified before and after the
    availability of cheap DNA sequencing.
  \item Why do we need sequences?
  \item Given an example of DNA sequence analysis that does not involve the
    alignment of sequences.
  \item What do we mean by, and when do we make use of sequence assembly?

      $a[$i] = $a[$i-2] + $a[$i-1];

\item What is the difference between:

  \begin{perlcode}
    if($a eq $b)
  \end{perlcode}
  and

  \begin{perlcode}
    if($a == $b)
  \end{perlcode}
  When would you use one rather than the other?
\item What will the following code print:

  \begin{perlcode}
  $a = 10;
  $b = 8;
  if($b = $a){
    print "$a is equal to $b\n";
  }else{
    print "$a is not equal to $b\n";
  }
  \end{perlcode}
  Read carefullly; there is a small trick here.
