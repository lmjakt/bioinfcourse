The term time has 13 weeks (34-46), with 2 2 hour sessions scheduled per week.
However, due to external meetings (on weeks 38, 41 and 44 Monday), 
11 and a half weeks are available.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{33}
\item -Mon: General Introduction to the course and to what
     is expected of the students. Use second half to understand the students' background.
    -Wed: Central Dogma and the flow of information.
\item -Mon: Bioinformatics, general introduction to the problem domain. (Why we spend so much time on sequences).
    -Wed: Biological databases and sequence formats.
\item -Mon: Pairwise Sequence alignment (substitution matrices, etc). 
    -Wed: Multiple sequence alignment and phylogeny (relationship to evolution).
\item -Mon: Informatics. Practical aspects (computers, operating systems, file systems, applications) 1.
    -Wed: Informatics. Practical aspects (computers, operating systems, file systems, applications) 2.
\item -Mon: Leave
    -Wed: Leave
\item -Mon: Practical sequence alignment. Web based demonstrations / practicals? 
    -Wed: Database searches (Blast, Blat, etc), theory \& practical considerations.
\item -Mon: Mathematical considerations 1. Summary statistics (derivatives): means \& variances.
    -Wed: Mathematical considerations 2. Linking distributions to probabilities.
\item -Mon: Regulation of transcription (Promoters, trans factors, cis acting elements, chromatin).
    -Wed: Cells as systems 2. Integration of input and output with state.
\item -Mon: Leave.
    -Wed: Leave.
\item -Mon: Genomics / Transcriptome / Proteome.
    -Wed: Omics: purpose and methods?
\item -Mon: Leave
    -Wed: Visualising and analysing large data sets.
\item -Mon: Theoretical. Akaike's information content.
    -Wed: Data to information the biologist's perspective. (Opposite)
\item -Mon: Databases, esp. relational databases.
    -Wed: Databases, looking at Ensembl structure.
\end{enumerate}

I should also squeeze in a section on looking at large data sets This should include
things like:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Data structure
\item Overall patterns (similar to structure,  but related to biological questions)
\item Data mining (looking for specific things).
\end{enumerate}

I would also like to squeeze in a bit of R in doing that. That is likely to take
rather more time than a 4 hours in a week.

The order of the above should also be modified.
